# Purpose #

Teaching/refreshing myself the essential elements of C, to build experience with the underlying functional structures of software and the limitations of low-level languages.  Long-term plan is to translate knowledge of C into other "modern" descendants of the C family (Go, etc.).

Lessons and problems are based on Stephen Kochan's ["Programming in C"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26436.Programming_in_C), with the folders number accordingly

All basic aspects of the language were covered, with particular emphasis placed on:

'char' arrays and their limitations vis-a-vis modern implementations of strings

'pointers' and their importance for memory manipulations

'bitwise' operations and what they reveal about underlying 32 and 64-bit processor architectures
